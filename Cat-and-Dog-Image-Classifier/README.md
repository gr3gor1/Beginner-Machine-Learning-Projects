# Cat and Dog Image Classifier
 FCC Project

### Description:
The point of this project is to create an image classifier so as to complete the Machine Learning in Python Certification on FreeCodeCamp. The project was mainly developed using TensorFlow documentation on convolutional networks for image processing and ultimately achieved almost 70% accuraccy. Also it was necessary to use transformations on images in order to create additional data to effectively train the model.
